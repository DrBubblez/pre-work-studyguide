# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 My motive was to build a study guide webpage and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 I built this so I can apply the skills I learn in the Prework. I learned how to create a webpage
 using HTML and CSS to a make the base and look and JavaScript to add functions to it!
